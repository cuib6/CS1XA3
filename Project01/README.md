
#i did the first and the sixth script. for the first step, i used an IF function to choose which script to use.
and for the second one which is the delete temporary files, i use the given code combined with if function, to test if there is a .tmp files in the repo.
If it is find then just delete it.



when u type 2~8 after project_analyze.sh, there will be several functions:
when u type project_analyze.sh 6, it will display deleting temporary files and will delete files
end with .tmp
when u type project_analyze.sh 4, it will excute the merge log programme.
when u type project_analyze.sh 8, it will require your ID and Password, and the id and the password will be given 
after u enter the wrong id-password set.
